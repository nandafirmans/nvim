# My Neovim Configuration

This is my personal Neovim configuration based on [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim), I'm using this for coding in TypeScript, React, and Flutter. I've spent time customizing it to enhance my productivity and make the most out of Neovim's features. Feel free to explore and use any part of this configuration that you find useful.
